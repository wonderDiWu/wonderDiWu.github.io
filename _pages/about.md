## **About Me**  
I am a **Research Fellow** at the University of St Andrews, working with [Dr. Blesson Varghese](https://www.blessonv.com/) as part of the **UKRI-funded** [National Edge AI Hub](https://edgeaihub.co.uk/) and [Edge Computing Hub](https://edgehub.co.uk/).  

My research focuses on **distributed machine learning** and **edge computing**, with an emphasis on **efficient deep learning systems**. I develop methods for optimizing **training and inference** on resource-constrained devices, bridging cloud and edge intelligence for scalable AI deployment.

## **Research Interests**  

### **âš¡ Scalable & Efficient Edge AI**  
- Optimizing AI workloads across cloud and edge for real-time, low-power applications.  
- Exploring **model compression, recursive proofs, and adaptive learning** for resource efficiency.  

### **ðŸ”— Federated & Distributed Learning**  
- Designing **privacy-preserving** and **energy-efficient** training paradigms.  
- Tackling **communication and computation bottlenecks** in decentralized AI.
