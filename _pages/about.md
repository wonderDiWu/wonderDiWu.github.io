Hi, I am a final-stage PhD student (having passed my viva and currently working on corrections) at the University of St Andrews.

## Research interests

My research focuses on the intersection of distributed machine learning and edge computing, aimed at making artificial intelligence ubiquitous in the future. To realize this vision, ML systems, both for training and inference, should not be restricted to running solely in the cloud but should instead work in synergistic cooperation with end devices and edge nodes. However, these systems currently face challenges such as intensive computation and communication overhead, limited resources, and a heterogeneous environment. My current research involves developing an efficient DNN partitioning-based system to address these issues.
