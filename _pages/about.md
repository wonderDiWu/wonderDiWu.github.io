# **Di**  
**Research Fellow, University of St Andrews**  
_UKRI National Edge AI_

## **About Me**  
I am a Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews under the UKRI-funded **National Edge AI** initiative. My research focuses on developing **efficient deep learning systems for edge computing**, including **model compression, federated learning, and system optimization**. My goal is to enable **ubiquitous artificial intelligence** by bridging the gap between cloud-based and edge-based machine learning.

## **Research Interests**  
My work lies at the intersection of **distributed machine learning and edge computing**, aiming to push AI beyond the cloud to work seamlessly across edge nodes and end devices. However, achieving this vision requires overcoming key challenges:  

- **High computational and communication overhead**  
- **Resource constraints on edge devices**  
- **Heterogeneous and dynamic environments**  

To address these issues, I am currently developing an **efficient DNN partitioning-based system** that optimizes training and inference across distributed edge infrastructures. My broader research interests include **scalable federated learning**, **energy-efficient AI**, and **intelligent system optimization** for real-world edge applications.
