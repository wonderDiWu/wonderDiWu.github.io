# **Di**  
**Research Fellow, University of St Andrews | [Edge Computing Hub](https://edgehub.co.uk/) | [National Edge AI Hub](https://edgeaihub.co.uk/)**  

## **About Me**  
I am a Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews, working with **[Dr. Blesson Varghese](https://www.blessonv.com/)** and contributing to the UKRI-funded **[National Edge AI Hub](https://edgeaihub.co.uk/)** and **[Edge Computing Hub](https://edgehub.co.uk/)**. My research focuses on **distributed machine learning and edge computing**, aiming to advance **ubiquitous AI** beyond the cloud. I specialize in **efficient deep learning systems**, optimizing training and inference on resource-constrained devices.  

## **Research Interests**  
ðŸ”¹ **Scalable Edge AI** â€“ Bridging cloud and edge intelligence for seamless, efficient AI deployment in both training and inference.  
ðŸ”¹ **Resource-Constrained Learning** â€“ Tackling computational, communication, and heterogeneity challenges in resource-constrained systems.  

## **Letâ€™s Connect!**  
I am open to collaborations and discussions on **Edge AI, Federated Learning, and Efficient ML Systems**. Feel free to reach out!
