# **Di**  
ðŸš€ **Research Fellow, University of St Andrews**  
ðŸ”¬ **UKRI National Edge AI**  

## **About Me**  
I am a Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews under the UKRI-funded **National Edge AI** initiative. My research focuses on **distributed machine learning and edge computing**, with the goal of enabling **ubiquitous AI** beyond the cloud. To achieve this, I work on **efficient deep learning systems** that optimize training and inference across edge nodes and end devices.  

## **Research Focus**  
ðŸ”¹ **Scalable Edge AI** â€“ Bridging cloud and edge intelligence for seamless AI deployment.  
ðŸ”¹ **Efficient Model Partitioning** â€“ Optimizing DNN training & inference across distributed environments.  
ðŸ”¹ **Resource-Constrained Learning** â€“ Overcoming computation, communication, and heterogeneity challenges.  

## **Current Work**  
I am developing an **efficient DNN partitioning-based system** to address key challenges in edge AI:  

âœ… Reducing **computation & communication overhead**  
âœ… Handling **resource-constrained edge devices**  
âœ… Adapting to **heterogeneous & dynamic environments**  

## **Letâ€™s Connect!**  
I am always open to research collaborations and discussions on **Edge AI, Federated Learning, and Efficient ML Systems**. Feel free to reach out! ðŸš€  

Feel free to connect with me to discuss research collaborations or explore innovative solutions in **Edge AI**! ðŸš€
