#### Research Fellow, University of St Andrews  
[Edge Computing Hub](https://edgehub.co.uk/) | [National Edge AI Hub](https://edgeaihub.co.uk/)  

### About Me  
I am a **Research Fellow** at the University of St Andrews, working with [Dr. Blesson Varghese](https://www.blessonv.com/) and contributing to the **UKRI-funded** [National Edge AI Hub](https://edgeaihub.co.uk/) and [Edge Computing Hub](https://edgehub.co.uk/).  
My research focuses on **distributed machine learning** and **edge computing**, aiming to advance **ubiquitous AI** beyond the cloud. I specialize in **efficient deep learning systems**, optimizing training and inference on resource-constrained devices.  

### Research Interests  
- **Scalable Edge AI** – Bridging cloud and edge intelligence for seamless, efficient AI deployment.  
- **Resource-Constrained Learning** – Tackling computational, communication, and heterogeneity challenges.  

### Let’s Connect!  
Open to collaborations and discussions on **Edge AI, Federated Learning, and Efficient ML Systems**. Feel free to reach out!
